- 👋 Hi, I’m @uscategui3 or  Esteban Uscategui Grosso, a person by nature curious and interested in others.
- 👀 I’m I'm interested in different things, for example:

  <ul>

  - drawing
  - creating music
  - painting
  - reading about writers that I don't understand, or that I don't understand what they mean.

  </ul>

- 🌱 I’m currently learning I constantly find myself with the need to understand what surrounds me, I wonder how it works, what is the force that exists in each thing, for example humanity and its constant needs and its essence, I am very curious and I like to understand how my life works.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on. I seek to collaborate with others, I believe that we are all part of the same being, so we are called to live in community, and I believe that I seek to collaborate as much as I can, I seek to be an activist of life.
- 📫 How to reach me is necessary, just to be authentic, I think it is important that I bring something to my life as well as look like an interesting person.
